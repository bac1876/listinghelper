# Session Status - February 1, 2025

## 🎯 Project Status: GitHub Actions + Remotion Video Rendering

### ✅ Completed Today:
1. **GitHub Actions Setup** - Fully configured and working
2. **Remotion Integration** - Renders videos with Ken Burns effects
3. **Fixed Multiple Issues**:
   - Package-lock.json missing (fixed)
   - JSON parsing errors (fixed)
   - Deprecated GitHub Actions (updated to v4)
   - Duplicate "tour-" prefix in paths (fixed)
4. **File Upload Support** - Added code to upload local files to Cloudinary first
5. **Railway Integration** - App correctly triggers GitHub Actions

### ❌ Current Blocker:
**Cloudinary Credentials Mismatch**
- Error: "401 api_secret mismatch"
- Videos render successfully but fail to upload
- GitHub Secrets contain incorrect Cloudinary credentials

### 📊 Test Results:
- Last test job: `tour_1754089132_773bcb30`
- GitHub Actions: ✅ Success (renders video)
- Cloudinary Upload: ❌ Fails (wrong credentials)
- Result: 404 error when accessing video URLs

### 🔧 To Fix (Next Session):

1. **Get Correct Cloudinary Credentials**:
   ```
   - Log into https://cloudinary.com/console
   - Copy exact: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Secrets**:
   ```
   https://github.com/bac1876/listinghelper/settings/secrets/actions
   - Update: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   - Update: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
   - Update: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
   ```

3. **Test Again**:
   ```powershell
   python test_with_urls.py
   ```

### 📁 Key Files for Testing:
- `test_with_urls.py` - Triggers GitHub Actions with test images
- `verify_cloudinary.py` - Checks Cloudinary account contents
- `get_latest_video.py` - Gets video URL from successful runs

### 🚀 Once Fixed:
The system will:
1. Accept image uploads or URLs
2. Render professional videos with Remotion
3. Upload to Cloudinary automatically
4. Return video URLs to users
5. Use 2,000 free GitHub Actions minutes/month

### 💡 Important Notes:
- GitHub Token expired during session - new one created
- Railway environment variables are correct
- The ONLY issue is Cloudinary credentials in GitHub Secrets

### 📍 Resume Point:
Start by fixing Cloudinary credentials in GitHub Secrets, then run `python test_with_urls.py` to verify everything works end-to-end.
