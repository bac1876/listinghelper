### System Components Verified

1. **Frontend (index.html)**
   - File upload works correctly
   - Progress tracking functional
   - Timeout extended to 15 minutes
   - Error handling improved

2. **Backend (working_ken_burns_github.py)**
   - Fixed field name mismatch (images → files)
   - Job tracking works correctly
   - GitHub Actions integration successful
   - Download endpoints functional

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Triggers properly on dispatch
   - Remotion renders videos successfully
   - Cloudinary upload works
   - No duplicate prefix issues

4. **Error Recovery**

## Known Limitations

1. **Frontend Timeout**: UI times out after 15 minutes for long renders
2. **No Webhooks**: System relies on polling (adds ~10s delay)
3. **No Progress Persistence**: Refreshing page loses progress

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Configure webhooks for instant updates
2. **Short-term**: Add progress persistence using sessions
3. **Long-term**: Implement email notifications for long renders

## Conclusion

The Virtual Tour Generator is **fully operational** and producing high-quality videos. All core functionality has been verified through multiple test scenarios with real MP4 downloads confirmed.

### Key Achievements:
