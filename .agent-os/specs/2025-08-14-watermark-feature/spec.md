# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Watermark Feature
> Created: 2025-08-14

## Overview

Add customizable watermark functionality to the ListingHelper video generation system, allowing real estate agents to brand their property tour videos with company logos. This feature will enhance professional branding and maintain visual consistency across all generated video content.

## User Stories

### Company Branding
As a real estate agent, I want to add my company logo as a watermark to generated property tour videos, so that my brand remains visible throughout the entire video presentation.

**Workflow:** Agent uploads their company logo (PNG format with transparency support), selects watermark position (corner or center placement), adjusts opacity level (10%-100%), and generates videos with consistent branding applied to all scenes.

### Professional Marketing
As a marketing professional, I want to control watermark positioning and transparency, so that the logo enhances rather than distracts from the property showcase while maintaining brand visibility.

**Workflow:** User accesses watermark settings panel, uploads PNG logo file, uses position selector (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, center), adjusts opacity slider, previews watermark placement, and applies settings to video generation process.

## Spec Scope

1. **Logo Upload System** - Support PNG file upload with transparency preservation and automatic size optimization for video overlay
2. **Position Control** - Provide five positioning options (four corners plus center) with proper padding from edges
3. **Opacity Adjustment** - Enable transparency control from 10% to 100% with real-time preview capability
4. **FFmpeg Integration** - Seamlessly integrate watermark overlay into existing Ken Burns video generation pipeline
5. **Settings Persistence** - Save watermark preferences per user session with option to clear/reset settings

## Out of Scope

- Multiple watermark support (only one logo per video)
- Animated watermarks or logo effects
- Text-based watermark generation
- Watermark rotation or skewing capabilities
- Advanced positioning with pixel-perfect coordinates

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Web Interface Enhancement** - Updated frontend with watermark upload, position selector, and opacity controls fully integrated into existing UI
2. **Video Generation Update** - Modified FFmpeg processing pipeline that applies watermarks to all generated Ken Burns effect videos with proper scaling and positioning
3. **Settings Management** - Functional watermark settings that persist during user session and properly integrate with existing video generation workflow
