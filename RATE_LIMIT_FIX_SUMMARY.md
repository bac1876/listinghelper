# Rate Limit Fix Summary

## The Problem
Your app was hitting GitHub API rate limits (5000/hour) within minutes, causing:
- First upload works
- Second upload fails  
- "401 Bad credentials" errors (misleading - was actually rate limit)
- Intermittent failures

## Root Cause
The status polling endpoint (`/api/virtual-tour/job/{id}/status`) was calling GitHub API every 2 seconds:
- Frontend polls status every 2 seconds
- Each poll = 1 GitHub API call
- 30 polls/minute = 30 API calls
- Multiple uploads = hundreds of API calls
- Rate limit exhausted in minutes!

## The Fix
**Removed GitHub API calls from status polling**
- Deleted the `check_job_status()` call from status endpoint
- Removed the `/check-github-job` endpoint entirely
- Now relies on Cloudinary polling which doesn't use GitHub API

## How It Works Now
1. Upload triggers GitHub Actions (1 API call)
2. Background thread polls Cloudinary directly (no API calls)
3. Status checks don't use GitHub API (0 API calls)
4. Total: 1 API call per video instead of 30+

## Result
- No more rate limit exhaustion
- Consistent performance (not "works once then fails")
- Can handle multiple uploads without issues
- GitHub API only used for triggering workflows

## Testing
After Railway redeploys with this fix:
1. Upload images multiple times in a row
2. Should work consistently every time
3. No more intermittent failures

Your rate limit will reset at 3:54 PM today, but with this fix you shouldn't hit it again!
