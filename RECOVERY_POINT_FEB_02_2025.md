# Recovery Point - February 2, 2025

## Current System State

### What's Working:
1. **GitHub Actions Integration** - Successfully triggers and renders videos with Remotion
2. **Railway App** - Accepts image URLs and triggers GitHub Actions
3. **Remotion Video Rendering** - Creates Ken Burns effects with configurable speeds
4. **Cloudinary Upload** - Videos upload successfully from GitHub Actions

### The Problem:
**Job ID Mismatch** - Railway generates UUID-style job IDs (e.g., `909fcbc3-6970-4211-83b3-979bc28ccc27`) but GitHub Actions creates its own job IDs with format `tour_{timestamp}_{hex}` (e.g., `tour_1754140427_0dff97a1`).

### Key Discovery:
In `working_ken_burns_github.py` line ~290:
```python
active_jobs[job_id]['github_job_id'] = github_result['job_id']
```
The Railway app correctly stores the GitHub job ID but the system is looking for videos using the Railway job ID instead.

### Solution Plan:
1. Update the Railway app to return the GitHub job ID for video URLs
2. Modify the job status endpoint to check Cloudinary using the GitHub job ID
3. Update download endpoints to use the correct job ID
4. Test the complete flow

### Test Results:
- Stock photos test: ✅ Successful (video at `tour_1754140427_0dff97a1`)
- Real estate photos test: ❌ Failed due to job ID mismatch
- Railway job: `909fcbc3-6970-4211-83b3-979bc28ccc27`
- GitHub job: Unknown (need to extract from Railway storage)

### Files to Modify:
1. `working_ken_burns_github.py` - Update video URL generation
2. `main.py` - Ensure it uses the updated logic
3. Test scripts - Update to handle both job IDs

### Environment Variables (Confirmed Working):
- Railway: All GitHub and Cloudinary variables set correctly
- GitHub Secrets: Cloudinary credentials match Railway

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the job ID handling in Railway app
2. Deploy updated code to Railway
3. Test with real estate photos again
4. Implement webhooks for real-time updates
5. Create better user interface

## Critical Code Sections:

### Current Issue (working_ken_burns_github.py):
```python
# Line 150 - Railway generates UUID
job_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Line 290 - Stores GitHub job ID separately  
active_jobs[job_id]['github_job_id'] = github_result['job_id']

# Problem: Video URLs use Railway job_id instead of github_job_id
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow (render-video.yml):
```yaml
# Line 134-136 - Uploads with GitHub's job ID
cloudinary.uploader.upload(videoPath, {
  public_id: jobId,  # This is GitHub's job ID
  folder: 'tours'
})
```

## Commands for Testing:
```bash
# Test with URLs
python test_real_estate_urls.py

# Check job status
python check_job_status.py

# Find video with GitHub job ID
python check_video_direct.py
```

## User's Permission:
"you have full permission to change and modify files"

## Time Estimate:
2-3 hours to complete all tasks and fully test the system.
