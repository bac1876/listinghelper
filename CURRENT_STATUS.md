# Current Project Status - August 8, 2025

## Overview
The virtual tour video generator is experiencing persistent failures in GitHub Actions during the Remotion rendering step, despite working locally.

## What's Working ✅
1. **Image Upload to ImageKit**: Successfully uploading images to ImageKit cloud storage
2. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: Workflows are being triggered correctly
3. **Local Remotion Rendering**: Works perfectly when tested locally with the same ImageKit URLs
4. **ImageKit Integration**: URLs are publicly accessible (confirmed with HTTP 200 responses)
5. **GitHub Secrets**: All required ImageKit secrets are properly configured in GitHub repository

## What's Failing ❌
1. **GitHub Actions Remotion Render**: Consistently failing after 35-55 seconds (too fast for actual rendering)
2. **Workflow Run #110** (latest): Failed at "Render video with Remotion" step
3. All workflows since #105 have the same failure pattern

## Recent Fixes Attempted
1. **Fixed durationInFrames errors** in RealEstateTour.tsx (Math.max to ensure positive values)
2. **Replaced broken placeholder.com URL** in test step with empty images array
3. **Reduced concurrency** from 8 to 4 to address potential memory issues
4. **Added memory monitoring** and full error logging
5. **Updated dependency installation** with npm cache clearing and --legacy-peer-deps

## Technical Details
- **Remotion Version**: 4.0.331
- **React Version**: 19.1.1 (latest)
- **Node Version in GitHub Actions**: 18
- **Workflow Duration**: 35-55 seconds (should be 2-5 minutes for successful render)

## Next Steps to Investigate
1. **Create a minimal test workflow** that only tests Remotion without ImageKit
2. **Add a test render with static/embedded images** to isolate network issues
3. **Check if React 19 compatibility** is causing issues in GitHub Actions environment
4. **Test with older Remotion version** (downgrade from 4.0.331)
5. **Add Chrome/Chromium browser diagnostics** to the workflow
6. **Test with a completely minimal composition** (no Ken Burns, just static image)

## Files Modified Today
- `.github/workflows/render-video.yml` - Multiple fixes for error handling and dependencies
- `remotion-tours/src/RealEstateTour.tsx` - Fixed durationInFrames calculations
- Various diagnostic scripts created (check_github_workflow_logs.py, verify_github_secrets.py, etc.)

## Key Error Pattern
- Workflows fail at "Render video with Remotion" step
- Upload to ImageKit step is skipped (never reached)
- Failure happens too quickly (35-55 seconds) suggesting early crash rather than timeout

## Access Points
- **Live App**: https://virtual-tour-generator-production.up.railway.app/
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/bac1876/listinghelper/actions
- **ImageKit Dashboard**: https://imagekit.io/dashboard/media-library

## Hypothesis
The issue appears to be specific to the GitHub Actions environment, possibly:
1. Chromium/browser initialization failing in GitHub Actions
2. React 19 incompatibility with GitHub Actions Node environment
3. Memory constraints despite reduction to 4 concurrent threads
4. Missing system dependencies for Remotion in Ubuntu runner

## To Resume Tomorrow
Start with creating a minimal test that bypasses all external dependencies and tests pure Remotion rendering in GitHub Actions to definitively isolate the problem.
