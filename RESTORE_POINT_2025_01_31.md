# Listing Helper - Restore Point (January 31, 2025)

## Current Status

### Issue: Videos are still choppy despite premium quality implementation
- Premium quality code is deployed (22 minutes ago as of this session)
- Videos still processing in 7.7 seconds (should be 60-120 seconds for premium)
- Resolution stuck at 854x480 even with 60fps

### Root Cause Identified
1. **imageio fallback has hardcoded resolution** (854x480) regardless of quality setting
2. **Simple linear interpolation** creates jerky movements
3. **Limited zoom range** (only 20% zoom)
4. **Railway using imageio fallback** due to OpenCV codec issues

### Work Completed Today
1. ✅ Implemented premium quality preset (60fps, 1080p, 8 sec/image)
2. ✅ Added quality selector dropdown to UI
3. ✅ Added FORCE_PREMIUM_QUALITY environment variable support
4. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub and deployed to Railway
5. ✅ Researched professional video API options

### Next Steps Agreed Upon
**Moving to Option 2: Professional Video API Integration**

Best candidates researched:
1. **Creatomate** - $41/month, $0.06-0.28/minute, best value
2. **Shotstack** - $49/month, real estate focused
3. **Bannerbear** - $29/month base, simple integration

## Restore Prompt for Next Session

"I need to continue working on the listing helper virtual tour generator. Yesterday we discovered that even with premium quality settings (60fps, 8 sec/image), the videos are still choppy because:

1. The imageio fallback has hardcoded 854x480 resolution
2. It uses simple linear interpolation instead of smooth easing
3. Railway deployment is using the imageio fallback due to OpenCV issues

We decided to integrate a professional video API (Option 2). I researched Creatomate ($41/month), Shotstack ($49/month), and Bannerbear ($29/month). Creatomate seems like the best value.

Please help me:
1. Create a proof-of-concept integration with Creatomate API
2. Replace the current video generation backend while keeping the existing UI
3. Test with their real estate templates
4. Ensure smooth, professional-quality videos are generated

The code is in C:\Users\Owner\Claude Code Projects\listinghelper and deployed to Railway at https://virtual-tour-generator-production.up.railway.app/"

## Key Files to Reference
- `imageio_video_generator.py` - Has hardcoded 854x480 resolution (line 27)
- `ffmpeg_ken_burns.py` - Main entry point for video generation
- `working_ken_burns.py` - API endpoint handler
- `static/index.html` - UI with quality selector
- `optimized_virtual_tour.py` - Has quality presets but not used by imageio

## Environment Variables Needed
- `FORCE_PREMIUM_QUALITY=true` (not yet set in Railway)
- Will need API keys for chosen video service

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test premium quality locally
python test_premium_quality.py

# Test imageio directly
python test_imageio_direct.py

# Test deployed app
python test_deployed_app.py
```

## Current Problem Summary
User uploads 4 images → Expects smooth 60fps video with 8 sec/image → Gets choppy 7.7 second video at 854x480 → Need professional API to fix quality issues
