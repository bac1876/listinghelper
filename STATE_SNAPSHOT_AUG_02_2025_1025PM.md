## System Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **GitHub Actions Integration** - Successfully triggers on image upload
2. **Video Generation** - Remotion creates videos with Ken Burns effects
3. **Cloudinary Upload** - Videos upload successfully after rendering
4. **File Upload Fix** - Frontend 'files' field now matches backend
5. **Job Status Tracking** - Proper correlation between Railway and GitHub job IDs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **Frontend Timeout** - UI times out after 15 minutes if rendering takes too long
2. **No Webhooks** - App relies on polling instead of instant updates
3. **User Experience** - Users see timeout error even though video may complete

### üîß Recent Fixes Applied
1. Fixed file upload field mismatch ('images' ‚Üí 'files')
2. Jobs no longer mark as completed prematurely when GitHub Actions is triggered
3. Extended frontend timeout from 10 to 15 minutes
4. Added better error messages for timeouts
5. Created diagnostic and recovery scripts

## Approved Testing Plan

### 1. Test with Stock Images
- Use Unsplash real estate images (no user images needed)
- Test quantities: 3, 5, 8 images
- Test all qualities: fast (3s), standard (6s), premium (8s)

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions
- Confirm jobs trigger properly
- Monitor rendering progress
- Check Cloudinary uploads
- Verify video URL accessibility

### 3. Test Error Recovery
- Handle timeout scenarios
- Test job recovery after UI timeout
- Verify helpful error messages

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Add webhook configuration
- Implement better status polling
- Add fallback mechanisms

### 5. Create Test Suite
- Automated multi-scenario testing
- Progress monitoring
- Video verification

### 6. Document Results
- Test report with timings
- Feature verification
- Usage instructions

## Current Issues to Address

1. **Webhook Configuration**
   - Not configured, causing polling delays
   - Need to add GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET to Railway
   - Configure webhook in GitHub repo settings

2. **Long Render Times**
   - Premium quality with many images can exceed 15 minutes
   - Need progress persistence across page refreshes
   - Consider adding email notifications for completion

3. **User Experience**
   - Add estimated time based on image count and quality
   - Show GitHub Actions link for manual checking
   - Implement job history/recovery page

## Next Immediate Steps

When resuming from this snapshot:
1. Run `python check_github_actions_status.py` to verify system is working
2. Configure webhooks if possible
3. Execute the comprehensive testing plan
4. Document all results
