# Deployment Status Report - Premium Quality Video Generation

## Current Status

### ✅ Code Deployed Successfully
- Latest commits pushed to GitHub at 16:18 UTC
- Railway deployment completed (based on health check working)
- Quality selector UI is live on the deployed app

### ✅ Local Testing Results
- Premium quality (60fps, 8 sec/image) works locally with imageio
- Creates 24-second videos for 3 images as expected
- File sizes are appropriate (~2.78 MB for test videos)

### ⚠️ Issue on Railway
The deployed app is still using **deployment quality** (24fps, 3 sec/image) by default because:
1. Railway environment is auto-detected
2. The code defaults to "deployment" quality when running on Railway to avoid memory issues

## Why You're Getting 7.7 Second Videos

When you upload 4 images without selecting a quality:
- Auto-detection sees Railway environment
- Uses "deployment" quality: 24fps, 3 seconds per image
- Total time: 4 images × 3 seconds ≈ 12 seconds (plus transitions)
- Processing completes quickly because it's the lightweight version

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Quality Dropdown (Immediate Fix)
1. Go to https://virtual-tour-generator-production.up.railway.app/
2. Upload your images
3. **Select "Premium" from the Quality dropdown**
4. Click Generate Virtual Tour
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for processing

### Option 2: Force Premium Quality on Railway (Permanent Fix)
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Add environment variable:
   ```
   FORCE_PREMIUM_QUALITY=true
   ```
4. Railway will auto-redeploy
5. All videos will now use premium quality by default

### Option 3: Upgrade Railway Plan (If Memory Issues Occur)
- Premium quality uses more memory (1080p vs 480p)
- If you get OOM errors with premium, upgrade Railway plan

## Testing Instructions

To verify premium quality is working:
1. Use the deployed app with "Premium" selected in dropdown
2. You should see:
   - Progress message: "Creating premium 60fps HD virtual tour (this may take 1-2 minutes for best quality)..."
   - Processing time: 60-120 seconds (not 7.7 seconds)
   - Resulting video: Smooth, 8 seconds per image

## Technical Details

The quality system is working correctly:
- Code detects Railway environment
- Defaults to lightweight "deployment" quality to avoid OOM
- Quality selector allows override
- FORCE_PREMIUM_QUALITY env var forces premium

The issue isn't a bug - it's the system working as designed to prevent Railway memory crashes.
