# Critical State - August 4, 2025
**Issue**: Upload stuck on "Initializing" even with 2 small images (117-560KB)

## Current Status
- Railway app deployed and healthy (Last-Modified: Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:30:02 GMT)
- API endpoints respond correctly to direct calls
- GitHub Actions integration working
- But UI uploads get stuck on "Initializing"

## Diagnostic Information Needed
1. **Browser Console** (F12):
   - Any error messages?
   - Does "Uploading X files:" appear?
   - Any CORS errors?

2. **Network Tab** (F12):
   - Is there a POST to /api/virtual-tour/upload?
   - What's the status? (pending, failed, etc.)

## Recent Changes
- Added file validation logging
- Added client-side console logging
- All API tests work via curl

## Git State
- Latest commit: 895286b "Add detailed file upload logging"
- All changes pushed to GitHub
- Railway auto-deployed

## Most Likely Causes
1. **FormData issue** - Browser not sending files correctly
2. **CORS problem** - Cross-origin request blocked
3. **Client-side JavaScript error** - Form submission failing

## Quick Debug Test
Try opening browser console and running:
```javascript
console.log(selectedFiles);
console.log(selectedFiles.length);
```

This will show if files are being selected properly.
