# Template Timing Summary

## Current Situation:
- **Original Template (5c2eca01)**: Has Ken Burns effects but runs too fast (2-3 seconds per image)
- **New Template (31b06afe)**: Also has Ken Burns effects, potentially better timing
- **Issue**: Creatomate's editor interface for adjusting timing is difficult to use

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Stick with New Template
Since both templates have movement, let's use the new one if it has better default timing.

### Option 2: Create Your Own Template
1. Duplicate one of these templates in Creatomate
2. Set the timing once to your preference (e.g., 8-10 seconds per image)
3. Save as your custom template
4. Use that template ID going forward

### Option 3: Contact Creatomate Support
Ask them for a real estate template with:
- Ken Burns effects
- 8-10 seconds per image (or adjustable via API)
- Smooth transitions

### Option 4: Use Local Generation
Switch back to FFmpeg-based local generation where you have full control:
- Set any duration you want
- Full control over Ken Burns effects
- No dependency on Creatomate's templates

## Current Template Comparison:
- Original: 5 photos, fast timing (12 seconds total?)
- New: 4 videos, potentially better timing
