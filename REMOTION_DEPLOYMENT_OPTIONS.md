# Remotion Deployment Options

## The Challenge
Remotion rendering requires a full Node.js environment with Chrome/Chromium, which makes it challenging to run in serverless functions like Vercel Functions.

## Best Options for Your Situation:

### 1. **Remotion Lambda** (Recommended for Vercel Pro users)
- Official Remotion solution for serverless rendering
- Runs on YOUR AWS account (not Vercel)
- Pay only for what you use (~$0.005 per minute of video)
- Scales automatically
- **Setup**: Need AWS account + deploy Remotion Lambda

### 2. **GitHub Actions** (Free Option)
- Use GitHub Actions to render videos
- 2,000 free minutes/month
- Your Railway app triggers GitHub Action
- Video uploads to cloud storage
- **Pros**: Completely free, reliable
- **Cons**: Slightly slower

### 3. **Render.com or Railway Background Jobs**
- Deploy Remotion as a separate service
- Railway app sends render requests
- ~$7/month for dedicated instance
- Always warm, no cold starts

### 4. **BrowserBase or Similar Services**
- Services that provide headless Chrome
- Remotion renders using their infrastructure
- Pay per minute of compute

### 5. **Keep it Simple: Railway + Queue**
- Add a simple queue to Railway
- Process videos in background
- Use your existing infrastructure

## My Recommendation:

Since you have Vercel Pro but Remotion doesn't work well with Vercel Functions, I suggest:

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Free & Simple)**
1. Set up GitHub Action for rendering
2. Railway triggers action via GitHub API
3. Action renders video and uploads to Cloudinary
4. Returns URL to Railway

**Option B: Remotion Lambda (Best Performance)**
1. Set up AWS account (if you don't have one)
2. Deploy Remotion Lambda (one command)
3. Railway calls Lambda function
4. Fast, scalable, ~$0.005 per minute

Which option appeals to you most?
